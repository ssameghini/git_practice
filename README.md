# Codecademy's Mixed Messages Project

This repository's purpose is to host the solution to a Codecademy challenge.
The project I need to develop will generate a random message for every person that uses it, in a fancy context.

## Technologies

For this project, I should use my knowledges of Javascript (mostly), Git and HTML/Markdown writing, with a bit of command line interface.

## Planned workaround

I intend to get the job done in a series of predefined steps:

1. [] Set my workspace (create needed files, synchronize with GitHub and get any expected libraries)
2. [] Write the code in a single `.js` file, unless I see that it could be cleaner to export and require modules.
3. [] Test the code, debug and rewrite what needs to be corrected.
4. [] Insert the function on an HTML styled page.
5. [] Done!

*All along this project I should be doing regular commits and some pushes to keep the progress saved*
