# Hello World!

Just getting used to **markdown**.

`This repository is for learning purposes only.`

Things about me:

* My name is Sebasti√°n
* I'm from Argentina
* I like web development

Now, some fancy code:

```javascript
let counter = 0;
while (counter < 30 {
    console.log("I'm the number " + counter);
    counter++;
}
```

*Bye!*
